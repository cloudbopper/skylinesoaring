# Skyline Soaring Club Member Portal - Roadmap

This roadmap outlines current and future development goals for the Skyline Soaring Club Member Portal. Items marked as ‚úÖ are complete.

## Completed Tasks ‚úÖ
- Move Django SECRET_KEY to `.env` file and rotate it.
- Replace `@login_required` with `@active_member_required` for superuser access.
- Set up Google OAuth2 login, including:
   - Safe credential storage in `.env`
   - First login with Google OAuth creates an account with default status
   - First login with username/password then allows later OAuth2 login (email match)
   - OAuth2 login can import Google profile photo
- Enforce profile photo uploads to be resized and aspect-ratio checked.
- Add support for rich biography field with TinyMCE and image upload.
- Enable users to upload profile photos; allow self-service photo edits.
- Add vCard QR code to member_view.html with proper home contact tagging.
- Add badge management system:
   - Admin-editable badges with HTML descriptions
   - Member-badge relationship with award date
   - Badge board with thumbnails of recipients
   - Accordion-style badge descriptions
   - Ordered badge display
- Add member name formatting helper (`get_display_name`)
- Improve navigation UI and add responsive hamburger menu.
- Setup flatpickr calendar popup for ISO 8601 date input.
- Automated profile photos using Pydenticon instead of the static image. 
- States should be a pull-down.  (Complicated by the fact that we have non-US ex members)
- Hyphenate phone numbers so the phone numbers don't look like barbaric strings of digits
- members_list page: differentiate home vs cell phone numbers. 
- members_list page: sort by lastname in a default view.  
- Create restricted site for Instructors
