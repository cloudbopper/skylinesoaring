# Skyline Soaring Club Member Portal - Roadmap

This roadmap outlines current and future development goals for the Skyline Soaring Club Member Portal. Items marked as ‚úÖ are complete.

## Completed Tasks ‚úÖ
1. Move Django SECRET_KEY to `.env` file and rotate it.
2. Replace `@login_required` with `@active_member_required` for superuser access.
3. Set up Google OAuth2 login, including:
   - Safe credential storage in `.env`
   - First login with Google OAuth creates an account with default status
   - First login with username/password then allows later OAuth2 login (email match)
   - OAuth2 login can import Google profile photo
4. Enforce profile photo uploads to be resized and aspect-ratio checked.
5. Add support for rich biography field with TinyMCE and image upload.
6. Enable users to upload profile photos; allow self-service photo edits.
7. Add vCard QR code to member_view.html with proper home contact tagging.
8. Add badge management system:
   - Admin-editable badges with HTML descriptions
   - Member-badge relationship with award date
   - Badge board with thumbnails of recipients
   - Accordion-style badge descriptions
   - Ordered badge display
9. Add member name formatting helper (`get_display_name`)
10. Improve navigation UI and add responsive hamburger menu.
11. Setup flatpickr calendar popup for ISO 8601 date input.
12. Automated profile photos using Pydenticon instead of the static image. 
13. States should be a pull-down.  (Complicated by the fact that we have non-US ex members)
14. Hyphenate phone numbers so the phone numbers don't look like barbaric strings of digits
15. members_list page: differentiate home vs cell phone numbers. 
16. members_list page: sort by lastname in a default view.  
- Create restricted site for Instructors
